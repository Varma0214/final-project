Overview:
This project is a simple Todo application built with React, designed to allow users to manage their tasks efficiently. The application provides functionality to add, view, edit, and delete tasks. Additionally, users can mark tasks as completed, and the application persists data using local storage, ensuring tasks are retained even after page reloads.

Features:

Add Task: Users can input a task into a text field and add it to the list by pressing a button or the Enter key.

View Tasks: Displays all added tasks in a list format.

Delete Task: Each task has a delete button to remove it from the list.

Edit Task: Each task has an edit button that allows users to modify the task.

Mark Task as Completed: Tasks can be marked as completed, which changes their appearance.

Persist Tasks: Tasks are saved to local storage, so they persist even after the page is reloaded.
Technologies Used

React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.

HTML: The standard markup language for creating web pages.

CSS: A stylesheet language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML.

Local Storage: A web storage API that allows JavaScript sites and apps to store and access data right in the browser.



Prerequisites
Node.js: Ensure you have Node.js installed on your machine. You can download it from Node.js.





Dependencies
React: The core library for building the user interface.
Font Awesome: For icons used in the application.
Bootstrap: For responsive design and styling.


Conclusion
This Todo application demonstrates a simple yet effective way to manage tasks using modern web technologies. The application is designed to be user-friendly and ensures data persistence through local storage. Feel free to clone the repository and enhance the application with additional features or styling.





# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
